    "*Insert*: we start at the root node and if the number is smaller than the value of the root node we go to the left. Otherwise we go to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Search*: start at the root node. If the data we are looking for is greater we go right, smaller goes left.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. To get rid of a leaf node is very simple. We just set its value to NULL. The complexity of this operation is finding the item to delete (*O(log n)*) and then deleting it (*O(1)*), so *O(log n)*.\n",
    "2. A node with a single child. We just have to update the references, so that the parent node's pointer is pointing to the child of the node we are deleting. The complexity of this operation is finding the item to delete (*O(log n)*) and then updating its references (*O(1)*), so *O(log n)*.\n",
    "3. The most complex case is where we want to delete a node with 2 children. For this we have a choice: we can look for the largest item in the left subtree (known as the *predecessor*) or the smallest in the right subtree (the *successor*). Whichever we pick (the implementation below uses the predecessor) we swap its value with the node we are deleting. We then set the node we found to NULL.\n",

    "2. Pre-order traversal\n",
    "3. Post-order traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In-order traversal:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we begin with the leftmost node and work our way up to the root node also recursively visiting the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the number example below we would start at the node with the value of 1 then go up a level to its parent node 3. This has a right subtree so we would visit the smallest (left) node of that tree, 4, then 6 and 7, before going back to the parent node at 3 then up again to the root node. We would then go to the right subtree and perform the same operation.\n",
